# Stack Overflow Post Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Stack Overflow posts using SQL, uncovering patterns in user activities such as voting, commenting, editing, and tag usage. The aim is to provide insights into user engagement, content quality, and trends on the platform while showcasing SQL proficiency.

### Dataset
The analysis leverages the publicly available Stack Overflow dataset from Kaggle, which includes data on posts, user activities, badges, and more. The key tables are:

1. **Badges**: Tracks badges earned by users as a measure of their achievements.
2. **Comments**: Contains comments on posts and their metadata.
3. **Post History**: Details changes and edits made to posts over time.
4. **Post Links**: Connects related posts to each other.
5. **Posts Answers**: Includes information about questions and answers posted on Stack Overflow.
6. **Tags**: Provides metadata about tags associated with posts.
7. **Users**: Details about registered users, including reputation and activity levels.
8. **Votes**: Tracks voting activity on posts.

### Objective
The project's primary goal is to analyze user behavior, post trends, and content evolution through SQL queries and insights derived from the dataset. The findings offer a deeper understanding of what drives engagement and quality on Stack Overflow.
